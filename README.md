Synthesis Epitech Project, ![Palindrome CI](https://github.com/Thyvene/SYN_palindrome_2019/workflows/Palindrome%20CI/badge.svg)

A palindrome is a word or a number which reads the same backward or forward (that is for numbers, numbers invariant when reversed).
A n-iteration turnover palindrome is a number which leads to a palindrome after n iterations of the following
procedure:

  1. reverse the number,
  2. add both the number and its reversal to obtain a new number,
  3. iterate from the first step until you get a palindromic number.
  
For instance:

121 is a 0-iteration turnover palindrome,
123 is a 1-iteration turnover palindrome and
4782 is a 3-iteration turnover palindrome.

The goal of this project is to find such iterated reversal palindromes, and the smallest number of iterations,
in order to get a palindromic number, given the constraints on this number of iterations.
